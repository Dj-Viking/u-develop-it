## Description 

- Create a CRUD application dealing with storing data into any machine's local database for purposes of learning basics of SQL databases.  
- Using JavaScript to send queries to the database for all CRUD operations. 
- Using SQLite3 npm package CLI interface to interact with the database. 
- And Express.js to interface the database and prepare this backend solution for a front-end code base.

## Installation

To reset the database run the commands

* <code>npm run migrate</code>
* <code>npm run seed</code>

  - This will ensure that the database is back to normal and not corrupted
  - The first command script Populates the database with a new database file, migrate writes the schema file to the database to create the tables and their attributes to hold data.
  - The second command will populate the tables with test data for purposes of demonstrating all CRUD operations


* Then finally run this command to start the node server instance to begin making queries to the database. In this activity we used Insomnia to make queries to the server, but you can use a browser too if you'd like.
* <code>npm start</code>
